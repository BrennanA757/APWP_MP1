* requirements.txt also includes the 'requests' library.
 
### Executing program
 
* Install the library by running 'pip install requests'
* Set the environment variable PRACTICE_API_TOKEN by running '$env:PRACTICE_API_TOKEN = "your token here"'
 
## Help
 
- "PRACTICE_API_TOKEN is not set"
-Run '$env:PRACTICE_API_TOKEN = "your token here"' and make sure you have a valid token.

- "401 Error - 'Token is missing or invalid'"
-Verify the token if you haven't already
-Re-set the environment variable
-Close and re-open the terminal

- "404 Error - Post does not exist"
-Use 'client.list_posts(mine=True)' to see a list of valid post IDs.
-Ensure you are using a valid post ID.

- "403 Error - Attempting to edit someone else's post'
-Ensure you are attempting to edit one of your posts. Client.py will not allow editing of others' posts.

- "422 Error - Field is missing or too short.
-Ensure that the post title, body, and any required fields are all optimally set.
-For example, 'client.create_post("My Title", body="Some content", tags=["week3"])

- "ConnectionError" or "Failed to extablish a new connection"
-Ensure you have a strong internet connection.

- "ModuleNotFoundError: No Module named 'requests'"

## AI Usage

I used AI to help write and understand the update, get, and delete functions for posts. It also helped a little bit with the status_check function.
